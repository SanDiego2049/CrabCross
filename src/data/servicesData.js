CrabCross provides comprehensive, enterprise-grade cybersecurity solutions that protect your organization's most valuable assets: your data, your reputation, and your customer trust.

Our cybersecurity practice is built on a foundation of prevention, detection, and response. We take a holistic, risk-based approach to security, recognizing that effective cybersecurity requires not just technology solutions but also people, processes, and continuous vigilance. Our team of certified security professionals—including CISSPs, CEHs, and security architects—brings deep expertise across all domains of information security.

We begin every cybersecurity engagement with a comprehensive security assessment and risk analysis. Using industry-standard frameworks including NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls, we evaluate your current security posture, identify vulnerabilities, assess threat vectors, and prioritize remediation efforts based on business impact. Our penetration testing and vulnerability assessment services simulate real-world attack scenarios, uncovering weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

Our security architecture and engineering services design and implement defense-in-depth strategies that protect your organization at every layer. We deploy next-generation firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), secure web gateways, and advanced endpoint protection platforms. Our zero-trust security implementations ensure that every access request is verified, authenticated, and authorized regardless of whether it originates inside or outside your network perimeter.

Identity and access management (IAM) is critical to modern security, and we implement sophisticated IAM solutions including multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), privileged access management (PAM), and identity governance. We help organizations implement least-privilege principles, ensuring users have access only to the resources they need to perform their jobs.

Data security and encryption are core competencies of our practice. We implement data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, establish data classification schemes, and implement secure data backup and recovery systems. Our database security specialists harden database configurations, implement activity monitoring, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

Security Operations Center (SOC) services provide 24/7 threat monitoring, detection, and response capabilities. Our SOC analysts leverage Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, threat intelligence feeds, and advanced analytics to identify and respond to security incidents in real-time.

Compliance and governance are increasingly complex challenges for organizations across all industries. Our compliance experts help you navigate regulatory requirements including GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, CMMC, and industry-specific frameworks. We conduct gap assessments, implement necessary controls, prepare audit documentation, and provide ongoing compliance monitoring to ensure you maintain adherence to applicable standards.

Security awareness training is a critical component of our cybersecurity services. We recognize that humans are often the weakest link in security, so we provide comprehensive training programs that educate your employees about phishing, social engineering, password security, and security best practices. Our simulated phishing campaigns test and improve your organization's resilience to social engineering attacks.

Incident response and forensics capabilities ensure your organization is prepared when—not if—a security incident occurs. We help you develop and test incident response plans, establish communication protocols, and build response teams. When incidents occur, our forensics experts investigate, contain, and remediate the threat while preserving evidence and ensuring business continuity.

Our application security services include secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) consulting, code review, security testing, and DevSecOps implementation. We help development teams build security into applications from the beginning rather than treating it as an afterthought.

Cloud security is a specialized focus area, with dedicated expertise in securing AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. We implement cloud security posture management (CSPM), cloud workload protection platforms (CWPP), and cloud-native security controls that protect your cloud infrastructure and applications.

CrabCross doesn't just implement security controls—we build security cultures. We partner with your organization to embed security into your DNA, ensuring that security becomes everyone's responsibility, not just the IT department's.
